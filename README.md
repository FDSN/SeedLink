# SeedLink protocol specification

This specification defines the SeedLink protocol for near real-time data stream transmission used primarily for seismological networks.

This repository contains the source of the documentation and serves as a coordination point for additions and changes to the specification.

The documentation may be found at: https://docs.fdsn.org/projects/seedlink/

## Documentation source organization

* The `draft` branch contains the latest draft documentation. All changes are first applied to
  this branch for review and merged with main for releases
* Specification releases are tags in the form `v.#.#-d#` on the `main` branch, following a release:

## Versioning

The versioning scheme used in tags uses the following form: `vMAJOR.MINOR-dDOC` where:
* `MAJOR.MINOR` are the version of the specification, and
* `DOC` is the version of the documentation.

The `DOC` version changes when the documentation has been updated with clarifications, typos,
etc. and does not imply any functional change to the specification.
