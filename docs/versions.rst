Versions
========

4.0

The goal of SeedLink v4 is to unify and standardize the extensions
added since v3.1, and to define new protocol extensions to allow for
support of a new version of miniSEED and FDSN identifiers.

SeedLink v4 is designed to be compatible with v3 -- any v3 client can
connect to v4 server (albeit missing the new features) and any v4
client can connect to v3 server.
