# SeedLink protocol specification

This specification defines the SeedLink protocol for near real-time data stream transmition used primarily for seismological networks.

This repository contains the source of the documentation and serves as a coordination point for additions and changes to the specification.

The documentation may be found at: https://docs.fdsn.org/projects/seedlink/

## Documentation source organization

* The `draft` branch contains the latest draft documentation
* Specification releases are branches from `main`, following a release:
  * The version (in conf.py) is updated appropriately on the branch, never in `main`
